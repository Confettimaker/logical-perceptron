# logical-perceptron
A perceptron capable of being trained to act as different logic gates

main.cpp shows a perceptron being trained as an OR and an AND gate.

multi-layer.cpp shows a simple three-neuron network in which the first neuron is being trained as an OR gate, the second an AND gate, and the third an XOR gate, taking the outputs from the input neurons.
